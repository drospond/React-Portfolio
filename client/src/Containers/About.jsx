            <p>
              I am a full stack web developer looking to enhance skills and
              challenge myself to become a better problem solver and leader. I
              will leverage my skills of task delegation, time management and
              product development learned as a manager in the food industry to
              produce more award worthy products. I will earn a certificate in
              full stack web development from Georgia Techâ€™s Coding Bootcamp in
              May 2020. I have learned and demonstrated skills in HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript to create styled, responsive web applications with high
              functionality using tools such as jQuery and third party server
              side APIs.
